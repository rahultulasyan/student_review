# student_review

Hello All, 

This is a basic implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) APIs.

This is done using SpringBoot framework in Java version 11.

Herein MVC model has been implemented thus project is segmented into different packages namely, 
StudentController, StudentService and  StudentRepository.

I have used h2 Database which is an in-memory database and also implemented Spring Data JPA.
